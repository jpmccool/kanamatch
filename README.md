Japanese kana flash card match game

## About

Kana Match is a simple flash card matching game that tests your knowledge of the Japanese hiragana and katakana syllabaries.

The program is written in Python using the PySide6 (QT) GUI framework, and should be compatible with Windows, Mac, & Linux -- although testing thus far has only been done in Linux.

Kana Match is still in development. Please check back for updates soon!
